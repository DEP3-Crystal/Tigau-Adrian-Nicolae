Ex2 from DEP3-Java Core is a draft with the implementation of the options menu, when the input is an invalid option number it gets stuck in the while loop even if a valid option number is entered and the valid option values (case 1 and case 2) are not taken into consideration.Im looking for a way to loop the whole menu, after that i want to increase the number of available options.
